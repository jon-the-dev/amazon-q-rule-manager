# AWS

Ensure we add alarms for resources
Alarms will have no action by default but if a sns_topic is provided, actions are enabled
All resources should be tagged if possible
Default tag keys and values (key:value) - customer:<customer-name>, application:sample-app, environment:dev, regulated:no, owner:<email>
