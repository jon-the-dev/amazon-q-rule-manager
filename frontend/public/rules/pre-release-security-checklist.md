# Pre-Release Security and Quality Checklist

This checklist is designed for LLM review of codebases before public release under GPL or MIT licenses. Each item should be verified and marked as ‚úÖ PASS, ‚ùå FAIL, or ‚ö†Ô∏è REVIEW NEEDED.

- [ ] No command injection possibilities

## üìÅ File System & Configuration

### Configuration Files

- [ ] Docker files don't expose unnecessary ports or services

- [ ] Security policy or contact information provided

### Code Structure

- [ ] No TODO comments referencing internal systems
- [ ] No debug print statements or console.log with sensitive data
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks with credentials

## üîó Dependencies & Third-Party

### Package Dependencies

- [ ] All dependencies are from public repositories
- [ ] No internal or private package references
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date and secure (check for known vulnerabilities)
- [ ] License compatibility check (GPL/MIT compatible dependencies)
- [ ] No unnecessary or unused dependencies

### External Services

- [ ] No references to internal APIs or services
- [ ] External API endpoints are documented and public
- [ ] No internal monitoring or logging service integrations

## üöÄ Deployment & Infrastructure

### Infrastructure References

- [ ] No internal server names, IPs, or hostnames
- [ ] No cloud account IDs or resource ARNs
- [ ] No internal DNS names or network configurations
- [ ] Docker images reference public registries only
- [ ] No internal load balancer or proxy configurations

### Environment Configuration

- [ ] Environment variables are documented
- [ ] Default values are safe for public use
- [ ] No production environment configurations
- [ ] Database connections use localhost/examples by default

## üìä Data & Privacy

### Sample Data

- [ ] Test data contains no real information
- [ ] Database seeds/fixtures use placeholder data
- [ ] Example configurations use example.com domains
- [ ] No real user accounts or profiles in examples

### Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] Log statements don't expose sensitive information
- [ ] No internal monitoring system integrations
- [ ] Error messages don't reveal system internals
- [ ] No telemetry pointing to internal systems

## üß™ Testing & Development

### Test Files

- [ ] Test credentials are fake/placeholder only
- [ ] No integration tests pointing to production systems
- [ ] Mock data doesn't contain real information
- [ ] Test configurations are safe for public use

### Development Tools

- [ ] No IDE-specific files with sensitive paths
- [ ] Debug configurations don't expose internals
- [ ] Development scripts use safe defaults
- [ ] No profiling or debugging code in production paths

## üìã Legal & Compliance

### Licensing

- [ ] License file matches intended license (GPL/MIT)
- [ ] All source files have appropriate license headers
- [ ] Third-party code attribution is correct
- [ ] No proprietary code or algorithms included

### Intellectual Property

- [ ] No copyrighted material without permission
- [ ] No trademarked names or logos without rights
- [ ] No patented algorithms or processes
- [ ] Original work or properly attributed open source

## üîç Final Review

### Manual Verification

- [ ] Clone repository fresh and test installation
- [ ] Verify all examples work with public data only
- [ ] Check that application runs without internal dependencies
- [ ] Confirm documentation matches actual functionality
- [ ] Test with minimal/default configuration

### Automated Checks

- [ ] Run security scanners (e.g., bandit, semgrep, CodeQL)
- [ ] Check for secrets with tools like truffleHog or git-secrets
- [ ] Verify license compatibility with FOSSA or similar
- [ ] Run dependency vulnerability scans

## üìù Review Notes

Use this section to document any findings, exceptions, or additional notes:

```bash
Date: ___________
Reviewer: ___________
Version/Commit: ___________

Findings:
- 

Actions Taken:
- 

Approved for Release: [ ] Yes [ ] No
Signature: ___________
```

## üö® Red Flags - Immediate Review Required

If any of these are found, **STOP** and conduct thorough manual review:

- Any string containing "password", "secret", "key", "token" with actual values
- Email addresses from your organization's domain
- Internal IP addresses (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x)
- Cloud provider account IDs or resource identifiers
- Database connection strings with real credentials
- API endpoints pointing to internal services
- Comments mentioning internal systems, people, or processes

## Reporting

- Generate a report called PRE_RELEASE_$TIMESTAMP.md
- NEVER show the exposed token/secret - redact all but the last 4 chars to allow for validation

## üìû Escalation

If uncertain about any item, escalate to:

- Security team for credential/security concerns
- Legal team for licensing/IP questions  
- Engineering lead for technical architecture questions

---

**Remember**: It's better to be overly cautious than to accidentally expose sensitive information. When in doubt, redact or replace with placeholder values.
