# External Code Review Checklist and Guidelines

## Open Source Risk Assessment Framework

When reviewing open source projects, evaluate these critical areas systematically:

### Security Assessment

- **Dependency Analysis**: Check for known CVEs in dependencies using tools like `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, or `snyk`
- **Data Leakage**: Scan for hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials, or sensitive data
- **Input Validation**: Review all user input handling for injection vulnerabilities
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Verify proper access controls and session management
- **Cryptographic Practices**: Check for weak encryption, insecure random number generation
- **Network Security**: Review HTTPS usage, certificate validation, and secure communication

### Project Health & Maintenance

- **Activity Level**: Check commit frequency, issue response times, and maintainer engagement
- **Community Size**: Evaluate contributor count, star count, and fork activity
- **Documentation Quality**: Assess README completeness, API docs, and security guidelines
- **Release Cadence**: Review versioning practices and security patch frequency
- **License Compatibility**: Verify license terms align with company policies

### Code Quality Indicators

- **Test Coverage**: Look for comprehensive test suites and CI/CD practices
- **Code Structure**: Evaluate architecture, modularity, and maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Check for proper exception handling and logging
- **Performance Considerations**: Review for potential bottlenecks or resource leaks
- **Coding Standards**: Assess adherence to language-specific best practices

### Supply Chain Security

- **Dependency Tree**: Map all transitive dependencies and their risk profiles
- **Package Integrity**: Verify checksums and signatures where available
- **Maintainer Trust**: Research maintainer reputation and history
- **Typosquatting**: Check for suspicious package names or maintainers

### Compliance & Legal

- **License Obligations**: Document copyleft requirements and attribution needs
- **Export Controls**: Check for encryption or restricted technology
- **Privacy Regulations**: Assess GDPR, CCPA, or other privacy law implications
- **Industry Standards**: Verify compliance with relevant standards (SOC2, PCI-DSS, etc.)

## AWS-Specific Reviews

### Well-Architected Framework (WAFR) Pillars

- **Security**: IAM policies, encryption at rest/transit, network security
- **Reliability**: Multi-AZ deployment, backup strategies, disaster recovery
- **Performance**: Right-sizing, caching strategies, monitoring
- **Cost Optimization**: Resource utilization, reserved instances, lifecycle policies
- **Operational Excellence**: Automation, monitoring, incident response
- **Sustainability**: Resource efficiency and environmental impact

### AWS Security Best Practices

- **Least Privilege**: Minimal IAM permissions required
- **Resource Tagging**: Consistent tagging strategy for cost allocation and governance
- **Logging & Monitoring**: CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and security monitoring
- **Network Isolation**: VPC configuration, security groups, NACLs
- **Data Protection**: Encryption keys management, data classification

## Review Output Format

Structure reviews with these sections:

### Executive Summary

- Overall risk rating (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Key findings and recommendations
- Go/No-Go recommendation with rationale

### Detailed Findings

- Security vulnerabilities with CVSS scores
- Maintenance and support concerns
- License and compliance issues
- Performance and scalability considerations

### Mitigation Strategies

- Immediate actions required
- Long-term monitoring recommendations
- Alternative solutions if risks are too high

### Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Score (1-5) | Weight | Weighted Score | Notes |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|-------|
| Security | X | 30% | X | Details |
| Maintenance | X | 20% | X | Details |
| Performance | X | 15% | X | Details |
| License | X | 15% | X | Details |
| Community | X | 10% | X | Details |
| Documentation | X | 10% | X | Details |
| **Total** | | **100%** | **X** | |

## Automated Tools Integration

Recommend using these tools in the review process:

- **Security**: Snyk, OWASP Dependency Check, Semgrep
- **License**: FOSSA, WhiteSource, Black Duck
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube, CodeClimate, ESLint/Pylint
- **Dependencies**: Dependabot, Renovate, npm audit

## Red Flags - Immediate Rejection Criteria

- Active malware or backdoors detected
- Critical CVEs with no patches available
- Abandoned projects (no activity >2 years)
- Incompatible licenses (GPL in proprietary products)
- No security contact or vulnerability disclosure process
- Hardcoded credentials or secrets in public repos
